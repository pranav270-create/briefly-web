## Running the Backend

To run the backend with development and debug settings enabled, use the following command:

```python
DEBUG=1 DEV=1 python main.py
```

- DEBUG=1 prints helpful debugging information to terminal
- DEV=1 caches email and calendar data in pickle files to save on token api costs when developing
- use the appropriate python command for you
